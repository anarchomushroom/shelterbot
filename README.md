Mostly just a placeholder for now, update this when thing is built

What this does:

* every day at 12pm UTC makes a call to the CardTrader API to get price information for Shelter From The Storm
* store that information and make a post on Bluesky about it
* "Hello, today is <DATE> and the lowest price of Shelter From The Storm is <PRICE>"
